                <p class="rtejustify">To address the connectivity issue, the efforts to bring Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) networks, such as Starlink, in Bangladesh is a bold step by the government. Starlink, the satellite internet service developed by SpaceX, is becoming increasingly popular across the globe for providing connectivity, especially in remote or underserved regions where traditional ground-based networks are not available. Starlink, with its constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, can provide internet connectivity directly to users in these areas without relying on ground-based infrastructure. It is kind of a plug and play kit that includes a dish (user terminal) and a router. The dish connects to the Starlink satellites while the router connects to the dish and provides wi-fi in a home, community facility or business.</p>
                <p class="rtejustify">We remember what happened when Cyclone Remal struck Bangladesh's southern coastal regions in May 2024. The cyclone's impact was particularly severe on the nation's telecommunications infrastructure. As the storm approached, power outages became widespread, with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) reducing electricity generation by more than half to prevent accidents during the cyclone. This led to at least 10,000 mobile towers, or base transceiver stations (BTS), to go out of service. Millions of people were affected by this disruption in mobile and internet services. The widespread loss of connectivity severely hampered communication and coordination efforts during the disaster response. Relief operations faced challenges in reaching the affected communities, and people struggled to contact emergency services or inform relatives of their safety.</p>
